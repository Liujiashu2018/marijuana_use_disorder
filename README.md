# Machine-Learning Prediction of Marijuana Use Disorder

## Introduction

Marijuana Use Disorder is one of the most prevalent Substance Use Disorders in the United States. This paper focuses on researching what demographic and social variables might be related to Marijuana Use Disorder and how accurately we can predict Marijuana Use Disorder using the selected predictor variables. The LASSO method was used for feature selection, and three machine learning models—logistic regression, random forest, and neural network—were constructed to compare the prediction accuracy and model performance.
